# My Portfolio Website

This is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase my projects and skills as a Software Engineer with a focus on AI and Web Development.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

This website is built using the following technologies:

-   **Astro**: A modern static site builder that allows for fast, content-focused websites. It's used as the primary framework for building the site.
-   **React**: Utilized for crafting dynamic UI components, bringing interactivity and a component-based structure to parts of the website.
